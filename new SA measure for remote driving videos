Development and validation of a new SA measure for remote driving videos

Abstract
Situation awareness (SA) needs during remote operation will differ to SA requirements during in-situ driving, 
meaning that standard measurements to assess SA in driving may not be appropriate. This paper aims to address 
the lack of standardisation in previous quantitative driving-related SA measures. Using the Taxonomy of Situation 
Awareness (TSA) developed in previous research (see Mutzenich et al, 2021), we designed SA questions for sixteen 
original driving videos. Each question was designed to measure a particular level of SA (perception, comprehension,
and prediction). We conducted a pilot study (n = 12) to trial the new remote SA measure, using an iterative 
qualitative and quantitative approach to revise and refine individual SA queries. We then utilised the SA measure
in an experiment (n= 94) and conducted an exploratory factor analysis to identify the underlying constructs 
of the instrument and to validate whether the questions successfully measured remote SA. Results suggest that
the SA measure has four underlying constructs: factor 1 represents spatial and environmental awareness, 
factor 2 represents anticipatory hazards, factor 3 dynamic driving actions and factor 4 represents other road users. 
Internal consistency of the criterion set was evaluated by Cronbach's alpha coefficient at Î±= 0.832, 95% CI [0.734, 0.896].
Factor loadings demonstrated that SA questions on perception, comprehension and prediction are combined when building
awareness of a remote driving scene, which suggests that measurement tools designed to hold SA levels separate may be
unsuitable in driving contexts. Our factor structure also corresponded with previous categorisation of the SA concepts
that underpin remote driving SA from the TSA. Our research goes towards developing a validated tool to measure the SA 
needs of remotely operating a vehicle.
